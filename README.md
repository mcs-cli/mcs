## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
brew install mcs-cli/tap/mcs
```

### 2. Add tech packs

Browse available packs at **[techpacks.mcs-cli.dev](https://techpacks.mcs-cli.dev)**, then add them:

```bash
mcs pack add owner/pack-name
```

### 3. Sync a project

```bash
cd ~/Developer/my-project
mcs sync
```

### 4. Verify everything

```bash
mcs doctor
```

That's it. Your MCP servers, plugins, hooks, skills, commands, agents, settings, and templates are all in place.

## The Problem

You've spent hours getting Claude Code just right — MCP servers, plugins, hooks, skills, custom commands, fine-tuned settings. Then:

- 🖥️ **New machine?** Start over from scratch.
- 👥 **Onboarding a teammate?** "Just follow this 47-step wiki page."
- 📂 **Different projects?** Copy-paste configs, hope nothing drifts.
- 🔄 **Something broke?** Good luck figuring out what changed.

## The Solution

`mcs` is a **configuration engine for Claude Code** — like Ansible for your AI development environment. Package everything into shareable **tech packs** (Git repos with a `techpack.yaml` manifest), then sync them across any project, any machine, in seconds.

| Without `mcs` | With `mcs` |
|---|---|
| Install MCP servers one by one | `mcs pack add` + `mcs sync` |
| Hand-edit `settings.json` per project | Managed settings composition |
| Copy hooks between projects manually | Auto-installed per-project from packs |
| Configuration drifts silently | `mcs doctor --fix` detects and repairs |
| Rebuild from memory on new machines | Fully reproducible in minutes |
| No way to share your setup | Push a pack, anyone can `mcs pack add` it |

## 🔍 Explore Tech Packs

Packs are modular — mix and match what you need instead of one monolith. Browse the full catalog, search by category, and find install commands:

**[techpacks.mcs-cli.dev](https://techpacks.mcs-cli.dev)**

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
 Tech Packs          mcs sync          Your Project
 (Git repos)  -----> (engine)  -----> (configured)
                        |
                   .---------.
                   |         |
                   v         v
              Per-Project  Global
              artifacts    artifacts
```

1. **Select** which packs to apply (interactive multi-select or `--all`)
2. **Resolve** prompts (auto-detect project files, ask for config values)
3. **Install** artifacts to the right locations (skills, hooks, commands, agents, settings, MCP servers)
4. **Track** everything for convergence — re-running `mcs sync` adds what's missing, removes what's deselected, and updates what changed

Use `mcs sync --global` for global-scope components (Homebrew packages, plugins, global MCP servers). See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for artifact locations and the full sync flow.

## 📦 What's in a Tech Pack?

A tech pack is a Git repo with a `techpack.yaml` manifest. It can bundle MCP servers, plugins, hooks, skills, commands, agents, settings, templates, and doctor checks — anything `mcs` can install, verify, and uninstall.

📖 **Full guide:** [Creating Tech Packs](docs/creating-tech-packs.md) · **Schema reference:** [techpack-schema.md](docs/techpack-schema.md)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **🧑‍💻 Solo Developer** — New Mac? One `mcs pack add` + `mcs sync` and your entire Claude Code environment is back. No wiki, no notes, no memory required.
- **👥 Teams** — Create a team pack with your org's MCP servers, approved plugins, and coding standards. Every developer gets the same setup with `mcs sync --all`.
- **🌐 Open Source** — Use `mcs export` to create a tech pack from your repo's config. Contributors run `mcs sync` and get the right MCP servers, skills, and conventions automatically.
- **🧪 Experimentation** — Try a different set of MCP servers, swap packs, roll back. `mcs` converges cleanly — deselected packs are fully removed, no leftovers.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Trust

`mcs` is designed to be non-destructive and transparent. Timestamped backups before modifying user content, `--dry-run` to preview changes, section markers to preserve your edits in `CLAUDE.local.md`, and SHA-256 trust verification for pack scripts. Lockfiles (`mcs.lock.yaml`) pin pack versions for reproducible environments.

## 🔍 Verifying Your Setup with Poirot

After `mcs sync`, want to confirm everything landed correctly? [**Poirot**](https://github.com/leonardocardoso/poirot) is a native macOS companion that gives you a visual overview of your Claude Code configuration — MCP servers, settings, sessions, and more — all in one place.

The perfect complement to `mcs`: configure your environment with `mcs`, then use Poirot to see exactly what's installed and running.
